## Getting Started
1. **Explore a Category**: Navigate to a folder (e.g., `Vehicle-Dynamics`) to find guides and scripts.
2. **Run a Script**: Each script includes instructions for setup (e.g., required libraries like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, or `python-obd`).
3. **Learn and Apply**: Use the guides to understand concepts and apply them to your vehicle.
4. **Contribute**: Share your own scripts or guides (see [Contributing](#contributing)).

## Example Use Case
As a car owner, you want to improve your vehicleâ€™s fuel efficiency:
1. Visit `Fuel-Efficiency-Optimization` and run `automotive_weight_reduction.py` to analyze lightweight material options.
2. Use `automotive_route_efficiency.py` to plan a fuel-saving route.
3. Check the `Powertrain-Engineering` folder for `engine_efficiency_calculator.py` to optimize engine settings.

## Setup Instructions
Most scripts require Python 3.x and common libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib python-obd pandas
